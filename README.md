# Welcome - Lets get started

This project shows an example of how I feel Welcomes offer feature would function. Of course its most likely very different than what it really is or will be! üçç

### What?
I built a frontend version of Welcomes new "Create an Offer" feature (Exercise A). This feature has two variations, an Employee/New Employee section and and HR section.

The HR section was the one that was most focused on in this project. You login as HR and you are instantly able to view your current potential employees offers. Clicking on an employee will quickly show thier position and current offer. Clicking the offer button will take you to the offer screen where you have more flexibility in changing offer details and adjusting employee benefits. Once offer information is decided, you can send offer to potential new hire. You can then send this offer information across company HR employees

Employee section hasnt been built out yet.

### Why?
I chose excersie A because I feel like its more in line with what I've work with on a day to day basis. Also, I feel like theres more freedom to create waht I wanted and extend on components or features if needed.

(havent worked too much with data visualization and graphs)

### Feedback:
Just wish I implemented a global state management library in the beginning. Wouldnt have had to pass as many state props down to other components. Was thinking about time but definitely will in the future.

Also, Im not the best designer.
